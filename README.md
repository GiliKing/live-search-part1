Build a Simple Live Search and Search Engine 

# Functionality

Users can see data stored in the database either by click the search button or

clicking the live search result directly.

Also it can store search result and save it so that user can view what they have being searching

# Things To Do
You can use any local server like xampp or wamp to test run.

You can input datas in the table by youself or you van use an API.

# future plan
To use an API to import data to the database rather the verified users doing it

Registered users can see what other undisclosed but registered users are searching in other words (search Trending);
